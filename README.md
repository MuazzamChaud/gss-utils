# GSS utils

Shared data transformation utilities for GSS data.

### Development - Getting started

#### Pre-requisites
- Clone this repo
- `pip install pipenv`
- `pipenv --python 3.9`

#### Install dependencies
- `pipenv sync --dev`

#### Start virtual environment shell
- `pipenv shell`
 
#### Test run
- Run one of the utils which should now exist as a binary within the environment

```
gss-utils % infojson2csvqb 
Usage: infojson2csvqb [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  infojson2csvqb - a tool to generate qb-flavoured CSV-W cubes from COGS-style
  info.json files.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  build  Build a qb-flavoured CSV-W from a tidy CSV
```

### Known issues

#### vcrpy does not overwrite interactions

When running a test with `record-mode=all` e.g.
```shell script
 pipenv run behave -D record_mode=all --tags=-skip -n '[Name of test]' features/scrape.feature
```
the scrape.yml sections are not overwritten. Instead, new ones are appended.

**Workaround**:
After running the tests, use the `clean-fixtures.py` script to remove repeated interactions.
The run the same tests with `record-mode=none` to confirm they all pass.
```shell script
 pipenv run behave -D record_mode=none --tags=-skip -n '[Name of test]' features/scrape.feature
```

Note, if you run into issues using `clean-fixtures.py` (this can happen as a result of other bad recordings being present) you
can currate the responses for a specific uri as detailed below instead.

#### Currating fixtures for a specific uri

To clean fixtures for a specific uri use `clean-specific-fixture.py` as follow:

To view all recording request/responses for a given uri without modifying anything:
`python3 clean-specific-fixture.py <FULL URI>`

To remove all instances of a specific uri request.responses:
`python3 clean-specific-fixture.py <FULL URI> -clean-all`

To clean all request-response recordings for a specified uri _except_ the one of your choice.

First run `python3 clean-specific-fixture.py <FULL URI>` to get an index for the request/response you want to **keep**, then:
`python3 clean-specific-fixture.py <FULL URI> -clean-but-keep <INDEX_NUMBER>`
