Feature: PMD metadata
  In an automated pipeline
  I want to build an RDF graph out of dataset metadata and ensure
  PMD specific terms are used.

  Scenario: generate metadata
    Given I scrape the page "https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/businessinnovation/datasets/foreigndirectinvestmentinvolvingukcompanies2013inwardtables"
    And set the base URI to <http://gss-data.org.uk>
    And set the dataset ID to <foreign-direct-investment-inward>
    And set the theme to <business-industry-trade-energy>
    And set the family to 'trade'
    And set the license to 'OGLv3'
    And set the modified time to '2018-09-14T10:04:33.141484+01:00'
    And set the description to 'Inward Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Involving UK Companies, 2016 (Directional Principle)'
    And generate TriG
    Then the TriG should contain
